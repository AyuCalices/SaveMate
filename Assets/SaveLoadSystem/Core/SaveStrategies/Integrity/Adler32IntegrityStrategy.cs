    /// Adler-32
    /// 
    /// Advantages:
    /// - Speed: Adler-32 is faster to compute than CRC-32 and cryptographic hashes, making it suitable for applications where performance is critical.
    /// - Simplicity: The algorithm is simpler to implement compared to CRC-32 and cryptographic hashes.
    ///
    /// Disadvantages:
    /// - Error Detection: Adler-32 is less reliable in detecting errors compared to CRC-32 and cryptographic hashes, especially for small data sets or simple error patterns.
    /// - Security: It is not suitable for cryptographic purposes as it does not provide resistance against intentional data tampering.
    /// </summary>
